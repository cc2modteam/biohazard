Drazu Industries Corp has provided an in-field upgrade to the Boston-Robotics virus bot system.

The upgraded virus bots now have extended capabilities that take advantage of recently discovered
remote code execution vulnerabilities found in the malicious Stanza code that has lead to the current
crisis. Using this new found weakness, the virus bot can now act as a hacked command relay, allowing
you to take control of hostile forces close to the virus bot.

Virus bots, once deployed now allow operators to take manual control of hostile units such as turrets,
bears, seals and walrus within a 250m radius of a bot.
